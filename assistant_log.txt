```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM sales_data 
GROUP BY region 
ORDER BY count DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Explanation: 
This query counts the number of rows for each unique 'region' in the 'sales_data' table, which represents the number of sales made in each region. It then orders these counts in descending order and returns the region with the highest count. This region is the most used region in terms of sales.

```sql
SELECT region, SUM(amount) as total_sales_amount
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```

Explanation: 
This SQL query calculates the total sales amount for each region. The `SUM(amount)` function is used to add up all the sales amounts for each unique region. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by the region column, so we get a separate total for each region.
